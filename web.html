                <h1>Open Source Software</h1>
                <br>
                <p><h2>Open-source software is a program that has publicly available code which 
                anyone with technical expertise can use, modify and distribute.The term 
                open source was introduced in the late 1990s by The open Source 
                Initiative (OSI).It is typically very easy to obtain and incorporate into digital 
                solutions.Now, it is important to remember that just because open source 
                software is free to use, it doesn't mean that just anyone can use it. Opensource software refers to lines of code (and its variations) that are 
                available.</h2></p><br>
            
                <h1>Open Source Software Vs Free Source Software</h1><br>
                <h2>Very often free source software is used as a synonym with open 
                    source software. <br>
                    Though similar, these two are different types of software. Both of  
                    them offer similar licenses but share different ideologies. <br>
                    Richard Stallman introduced the concept of free source software 
                    back in the 1980s. Its main goal was that all user have the right to 
                    operate, copy, share, study, change and improve this software. <br>
                    Open source software , on the other hand, was introduced in the late 
                    1990s by a group of individuals as a reaction to the limitations of free 
                    source software. <br>
                    The main difference they presented was that they changed the 
                    emphasis from freedom to security. And, they also brought other 
                    pragmatic benefits like transparency and cost savings.</h2>
